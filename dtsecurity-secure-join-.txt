           draft-richardson-6tisch-dtsecurity-secure-join-00

Abstract

   The WG will continue working on securing the join process and making
   that fit within the constraints of high latency, low throughput and
   small frame sizes that characterize IEEE802.15.4 TSCH.

1.  Introduction

   ## Motivation for Join Process ## Zero Touch Assumptions ##
   Terminology {#Terminology}

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119] and indicate requirement levels for compliant STuPiD
   implementations.

1.1.  Credentials

   ## One-Touch Assumptions ### Factory provided credentials (if any)
   ### Credentials to be introduced ## Network Assumptions ### Security
   above and below IP #### Perfect Forward Secrecy ### Join network
   assumptions ### Number and cost of round trips ### Size of packets,
   number of fragments ## Target end-state for join process ## Diagram
   of Join Process ## Description of States in Join Process # Protocol
   Overview ## New node announcement ### use of EARO messages ## Proxy
   to JCE ## JCE initiates to new node # Security Details (Security
   protocol?  Security process?) ## Security options ### EDHOC and
   OSCOAP ### DTLS/CoAP ### ???-insert-yours ## Forward Secrecy ###
   Rekeying of networks ### Rekeying of nodes ### Per-link key ## Node
   decommissioning ### Voluntary Revocation ### Emergency Revocation ###
   Expulsion of hostile node # Certificates and Authorizations ##
   Assymetric credentials ### chain of certificates from vendor trust
   anchor to network operator ## possession of public key (duckling
   model) ## Symmetric credentials ## Use of ACE Token for Ownership #
   Security Considerations # IANA Considerations
