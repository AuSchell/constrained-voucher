           draft-richardson-6tisch-dtsecurity-secure-join-00

Abstract

   The WG will continue working on securing the join process and making
   that fit within the constraints of high latency, low throughput and
   small frame sizes that characterize IEEE802.15.4 TSCH.

   Write abstract text once document is closer to finished.
