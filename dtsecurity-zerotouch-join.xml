    <abstract>


<t>This document describes a zero-touch mechanism to enroll a new device (the "pledge")
into a IEEE802.15.4 TSCH network using the 6tisch signaling mechanisms.  The resulting
device will obtain a domain specific credential that can be used with either 802.15.9 per-host pair
keying protocols, or to obtain the network-wide key from a coordinator.  The mechanism
describe her is an augmentation to the one-touch mechanism described in <xref target="I-D.ietf-6tisch-minimal-security"/>.</t>

<section anchor="old-introduction" title="Old Introduction">

<t>Enrollment of new nodes into LLNs present unique challenges.
The constrained nodes has no user interfaces, and even if they did,
configuring thousands of such nodes manually is undesireable from a human
resources issue, as well as the difficulty in getting consistent results.</t>

<t>This document is about a standard way to introduce new nodes into a 6tisch
network that does not involve any direct manipulation of the nodes themselves.
This act has been called "zero-touch" provisioning, and it does not occur by
chance, but requires coordination between the manufacturer of the node, the
service operator running the LLN, and the installers actually taking the
devices out of the shipping boxes.</t>

<t>The act of doing "one-touch" provisioning, where a node undergoes a site-specific
indoctrination process is described in <xref target="I-D.ietf-6tisch-minimal-security"/>.</t>

<t>The mechanism described here and in <xref target="I-D.ietf-6tisch-minimal-security"/> can be discovered by a new
node in a running network, so a device which has received a network-specific "one-touch"
setup, but which is located in another network, and is capable of "zero-touch" operation could
discovery this fact and operate in other mode.</t>

<t>Many of the components of the zero-touch mechanisms described here are in common
with <xref target="I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra"/> and <xref target="I-D.ietf-netconf-zerotouch"/>.
The on-the-wire pledge to join registrar protocols are different in this protocol from
those described in ANIMA, but conceptually operate identically.
The vouchers are identical.
It is expected that the back-end network operator infrastructure would be
able to bootstrap ANIMA-type devices over ethernet, while also being able
bootstrap 6tisch devices over 802.15.4 with few changes.</t>

<section anchor="Terminology" title="Terminology">

<t>In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
"SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
<xref target="RFC2119"/> and indicate requirement levels for compliant STuPiD
implementations.</t>

<t>The reader is expected to be familiar with the terms and concepts defined in
<xref target="I-D.ietf-6tisch-terminology"/>, <xref target="RFC7252"/>,
<xref target="I-D.ietf-core-object-security"/>, and
<xref target="I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra"/>.  The following terms are
imported: drop ship, imprint, enrollment, pledge, join proxy, ownership
voucher, join registrar/coordinator.  The following terms are repeated here for readability,
but this document is not authoritative for their definition:</t>

<t><list style="hanging">
  <t hangText='pledge'>
  the prospective device, which has the identity provided to
at the factory.  Neither the device nor the network knows if the
device yet knows if this device belongs with this network.</t>
  <t hangText='Joined Node'>
  the prospective device, after having completing the join process, often just called a Node.</t>
  <t hangText='Join Proxy (JP):'>
  a stateless relay that provides connectivity between the pledge
and the join registrar/coordinator.</t>
  <t hangText='Join Registrar/Coordinator (JRC):'>
  central entity responsible for authentication and authorization of joining nodes.</t>
  <t hangText='Audit Token'>
  A signed token from the manufacturer authorized signing
authority indicating that the bootstrapping event has been
successfully logged.  This has been referred to as an
"authorization token" indicating that it authorizes bootstrapping
to proceed.</t>
  <t hangText='Ownership Voucher'>
  A signed voucher from the vendor vouching that a specific domain "owns"
the new entity as defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-netconf-zerotouch"/>.</t>
  <t hangText='MIC'>
  manufacturer installed certificate. An <xref target="ieee802-1AR"/> identity.</t>
</list></t>

</section>
<section anchor="credentials" title="Credentials">

<t>In the zero-touch scenario, every device expected to be drop shipped would
have an <xref target="ieee802-1AR"/> manufacturer installed certificate (MIC). The
private key part of the certificate would either be generated in the device,
or installed securely (and privately) as part of the manufacturing process.
<xref target="cullenCiscoPhoneDeploy"/> provides an example of process which has been active
for a good part of a decade.</t>

<t>The MIC would be signed by the manufacturer's CA, the public key component of
that would be included in the firmware.</t>

<section anchor="one-touch-assumptions" title="One-Touch Assumptions">

<t>This document interacts with the one-touch solution described in <xref target="I-D.ietf-6tisch-minimal-security"/>.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="factory-provided-credentials-if-any" title="Factory provided credentials (if any)">

<t>When a manufacturer installed certificate is provided as the IDevID, it
SHOULD contain a number of fields.  <xref target="I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra"/>
provides a detailed set of requirements.</t>

<t>A manufacturer unique serial number MUST be provided in the serialNumber
SubjectAltName extension, and MAY be repeated in the Common Name. There are
no sequential or numeric requirements on the serialNumber, it may be any
unique value that the manufacturer wants to use.  The serialNumber SHOULD be
printed on the packaging and/or on the device in a discrete way so that failures
can be physically traced to the relevant device.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="credentials-to-be-introduced" title="Credentials to be introduced">

<t>The goal of the bootstrap process is to introduce one or more new locally
relevant credentials:</t>

<t><list style="numbers">
  <t>a certificate signed by a local certificate authority/registrar. This is
the LDevID of <xref target="ieee802-1AR"/>.</t>
  <t>alternatively, a network-wide key to be used to secure L2 traffic.</t>
  <t>alternatively, a network-wide key to be used to authenticate per-peer
keying of L2 traffic using a mechanism such as provided by <xref target="ieee802159"/>.</t>
</list></t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="network-assumptions" title="Network Assumptions">

<t>This document is about enrollment of constrained devices <xref target="RFC7228"/> to a
constrained network.  Constrained networks is such as <xref target="ieee802154"/>, and in
particular the time-slotted, channel hopping (tsch) mode, feature low
bandwidths, and limited opportunities to transmit.  A key feature of these
networks is that receivers are only listening at certain times.</t>

<section anchor="security-above-and-below-ip" title="Security above and below IP">

<t>802.15.4 networks have three kinds of layer-2 security:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>a network key that is shared with all nodes and is used for unicast and multicast.  The key may be used for privacy, and it may be used in some cases for authentication only (in the case of enhanced beacons).</t>
  <t>a series of network keys that are shared (agreed to) between pairs of nodes (the per-peer key)</t>
  <t>a network key that is shared with all nodes (through a group key management system), and is used for multicast traffic only, while a per-pair key is used for unicast traffic</t>
</list></t>

<t>Setting up the credentials to bootstrap one of these kinds of security,
(or directly configuring the key itself for the first case) is required.
This is the security below the IP layer.</t>

<t>Security is required above the IP layer: there are three aspects which the
credentials in the previous section are to be used.</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>to provide for secure connection with a Path Computation Element <xref target="RFC4655"/>, or other LLC (see ({RFC7554}} section 3).</t>
  <t>to initiate a connection between a Resource Server (RS) and an application layer Authorization Server (AS and CAS from <xref target="I-D.ietf-ace-actors"/>).</t>
</list></t>

<section anchor="perfect-forward-secrecy" title="Perfect Forward Secrecy">

<t>Perfert Forward Secrecy (PFS) is the property of a protocol such that complete
knowledge of the crypto state (for instance, via a memory dump) at
time X does not imply that data from a disjoint time Y can also be recovered.
(<xref target="PFS"/>).</t>

<t>PFS is important for two reasons: one is that it offers protection against
the compromise of a node.  It does this by changing the keys in a
non-deterministic way. This second property also makes it much easier to
remove a node from the network, as any node which has not participated in
the key changing process will find itself no longer connected.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="join-network-assumptions" title="Join network assumptions">

<t>The network which the new pledge will connect to will have to have the following properties:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>a known PANID.  The PANID 0xXXXX where XXXX is the assigned RFC# for this document is suggested.</t>
  <t>a minimal schedule with some Aloha time.  This is usually in the same slotframe as the Enhanced Beacon, but a pledge MUST listen for an unencrypted Enhanced Beacon to so that it can synchronize.</t>

<section anchor="target-end-state-for-join-process" title="Target end-state for join process">

<t>At the end of the zero-touch join process there will be a symmetric key protected channel
between the Join Registrar/Coordinator and the pledge, now known as a Joined Node.  This
channel may be rekeyed via new exchange of asymmetric exponents (ECDH for instance), authenticated
using the domain specific credentials created during the join process.</t>

<t>This channel is in the form of an OSCOAP protected connection with <xref target="I-D.ietf-core-comi"/> encoded objects.
This document includes definition of a <xref target="I-D.ietf-netconf-keystore"/> compatible objects for
encoding of the relevant <xref target="I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra"/> objects.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="join-protocol" title="Join Protocol">

<t>The pledge join protocol state machine is described in <xref target="I-D.ietf-6tisch-minimal-security"/>,
in section XYZ.  The pledge recognizes that it is in zero-touch configuration by the following
situation:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>no PSK has been configured for the network in which it has joined.</t>
  <t>the pledge has no locally defined certificate (no LDevID), only an IDevID.</t>
  <t>the network asserts an identity that the pledge does not recognize.</t>
</list></t>

<t>All of these conditions MUST be true.  If any of these are not true, then the pledge has either been
connected to the wrong network, or it has already been bootstrapped into a
different network, and it should wait until it finds that network.</t>

<t>The zero-touch process consists of three stages:</t>

<t><list style="numbers">
  <t>the key agreement process</t>
  <t>the provisional enrollment process</t>
  <t>the key distribution process</t>
</list></t>

<section anchor="key-agreement-process" title="Key Agreement process">

<t>The key agreement process is identical to <xref target="I-D.ietf-6tisch-minimal-security"/>.
The process uses EDHOC with certificates.</t>

<t>The pledge will have to trust the JRC provisionally, as described
in <xref target="I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra"/>, section 3.1.2, and
in section 4.1.1 of <xref target="RFC7030"/>.</t>

<t>The JRC will be able to validate the IDevID of the pledge using the
manufacturer's CA.</t>

<t>The pledge may not know if it is in a zero-touch or one-touch situation: the
pledge may be able to verify the JRC based upon trust anchors that were
installed at manufacturing time.  In that case, the pledge runs the
simplified one-touch process.</t>

<t>The pledge signals in the EDHOC message_2 if it has accepted the JRC
certificate.  The JRC will in general, not trust the pledge with the network
keys until it has provided the pledge with a voucher.  The pledge will notice
the absence of the provisioning keys.</t>

<t>XXX - there could be some disconnect here.  May need additional signals here.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="provisional-enrollment-process" title="Provisional Enrollment process">

<t>When the pledge determines that it can not verify the certificate of the JRC
using built-in trust anchors, then it enters a provisional state.  In this
state, it keeps the channel created by EDHOC open.</t>

<t>A new EDHOC key derivation is done by the JRC and pledge using a new label,
"6tisch-provisional".</t>

<t>The pledge runs as a passive CoMI server, leaving the JRC to drive the
enrollment process.   The JRC can interrogate the pledge in a variety of
fashions as shown below: the process terminates when the JRC provides
the pledge with an ownership voucher and the pledge leaves the provisional
state.</t>

<t>A typical interaction involves the following requests:</t>

<section anchor="privacy-considerations-1" title="Privacy Considerations">

<t><xref target="I-D.ietf-6lo-privacy-considerations"/> details a number of privacy
considerations important in Resource Constrained nodes.  There are two
networks and three sets of constrained nodes to consider. They are:
1. the production nodes on the production network.
2. the new pledges, which have yet to enroll, and which are on a join
network.
3. the production nodes which are also acting as proxy nodes.</t>

<section anchor="privacy-considerations-for-production-network" title="Privacy Considerations for Production network">

<t>The details of this are out of scope for this document.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="privacy-considerations-for-new-pledges" title="Privacy Considerations for New Pledges">

<t>New Pledges do not yet receive Router Advertisements with PIO options, and so
configure link-local addresses only based upon layer-2 addresses using the
normal SLAAC mechanisms described in <xref target="RFC4191"/>.</t>

<t>These link-local addresses are visible to any on-link eavesdropper (who is
synchronized to the same Join Assistant), so regardless of what is chosen
they can be seen.  This link-layer traffic is encapsulated by the Join
Assistant into IPIP packets and carried to the JCE.  The traffic SHOULD never
leave the operator's network, and no outside traffic should enter, so it
should not be possible to do any ICMP scanning as described in
<xref target="I-D.ietf-6lo-privacy-considerations"/>.</t>

<t>The join process described herein requires that some identifier meaningful to
the network operator be communicated to the JCE via the Neighbor
Advertisement's ARO option.  This need not be a manufacturer created EUI-64
as assigned by IEEE; it could be another value with higher entropy and less
interesting vendor/device information.  Regardless of what is chosen, it can
be used to track where the device attaches.</t>

<t>For most constrained device, network attachment occurs very infrequently,
often only once in their lifetime, so tracking opportunities may be rare.</t>

<t>Further, during the enrollment process, a DTLS connection
connection will be created.  Unless TLS1.3 is used, the device identity will
be visible to passive observers in the 802.11AR IDevID certificate that is
sent.  Even when TLS1.3 is used, an active attacker could collect the
information by simply connecting to the device; it would not have to
successful complete the negotiation either, or even attempt to
Man-In-The-Middle the device.</t>

<t>There is, at the same time, significant value in avoiding a link-local DAD
process by using an IEEE assigned EUI-64, and there is also significant
advantage to the operator being able to see what the vendor of the new device
is.</t>

<section anchor="eui-64-derived-address-for-join-time-iid" title="EUI-64 derived address for join time IID">

<t>It is therefore suggested that the IID used in the link-local address
used during the join process be a vendor assigned EUI-64.  After the join
process has concluded, the device SHOULD be assigned a unique randomly
generated long address, and a unique short address (not based upon the
vendor EUI-64) for use at link-layer. At that point, all layer-3 content
is encrypted by the layer-2 key.</t>
