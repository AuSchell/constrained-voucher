    <abstract>


<t>This document describes a zero-touch mechanism to enroll a new device (the "pledge")
into a IEEE802.15.4 TSCH network using the 6tisch signaling mechanisms.  The resulting
device will obtain a domain specific credential that can be used with either 802.15.9 per-host pair
keying protocols, or to obtain the network-wide key from a coordinator.  The mechanism
describe her is an augmentation to the one-touch mechanism described in <xref target="I-D.ietf-6tisch-minimal-security"/>.</t>

<section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">

<t>Enrollment of new nodes into LLNs present unique challenges.
The constrained nodes has no user interfaces, and even if they did,
configuring thousands of such nodes manually is undesireable from a human
resources issue, as well as the difficulty in getting consistent results.</t>

<t>This document is about a standard way to introduce new nodes into a 6tisch
network that does not involve any direct manipulation of the nodes themselves.
This act has been called "zero-touch" provisioning, and it does not occur by
chance, but requires coordination between the manufacturer of the node, the
service operator running the LLN, and the installers actually taking the
devices out of the shipping boxes.</t>

<t>This document is a constrained profile of <xref target="I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra"/>.  The above
document/protocol is referred by by it's acronym: BRSKI. The pronounciation of which is
"brew-ski", a common north american slang for beer with a pseudo-polish ending.</t>

<t>This document follows the same structure as it's parent in order to emphasize the similarities,
but specializes a number of things to constrained networks of constrained devices.
Like ANIMA's BRSKI, the networks which are in scope for this protocol are deployed by a
professional operator.  The deterministic mechanisms which have been designed into 6tisch
have been created to satisfy the operational needs of industrial settings.</t>

<t>This document builds upon the "one-touch" provisioning described in <xref target="I-D.ietf-6tisch-minimal-security"/>,
reusing the OSCOAP Join Request mechanism when appropriate.
In addition, it uses the CoAP adaption of EST defined in <xref target="I-D.vanderstok-ace-coap-est"/>
in an identical way.</t>

<t>Otherwise, this document follows BRSKI with the following high-level changes:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>HTTP is replaced with CoAP.</t>
  <t>TLS (HTTPS) is replaced with either DTLS+CoAP, or EDHOC/OSCOAP+CoAP</t>
  <t>the domain-registrar anchor certificate is replaced with a Raw Public Key (RPK) using <xref target="RFC7250"/>.</t>
  <t>the PKCS7 signed JSON voucher format is replaced with CWT</t>
  <t>the GRASP discovery mechanism for the Proxy is replaced with an announcement in the Enhanced Beacon <xref target="I-D.richardson-6tisch-join-enhanced-beacon"/></t>
  <t>the TCP circuit proxy mechanism is not used.  The IPIP mechanism if mandatory to implement when deployed with DTLS, while the CoAP based stateless proxy mechanism is used for OSCOAP/EDHOC.</t>
  <t>real time clocks are assumed to be impossible, so expiry dates in ownership vouchers are never used</t>
  <t>nonce-full vouchers are encouraged, but off-line nonce-less operation is also supported</t>
</list></t>

<t>802.1AR Client certificates are retained, but optionally are specified by reference rather than value.</t>

<t>It is expected that the back-end network operator infrastructure would be
able to bootstrap ANIMA BRSKI-type devices over ethernet, while also being able
bootstrap 6tisch devices over 802.15.4 with few changes.</t>

<section anchor="Terminology" title="Terminology">

<t>In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
"SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
<xref target="RFC2119"/> and indicate requirement levels for compliant STuPiD
implementations.</t>

<t>The reader is expected to be familiar with the terms and concepts defined in
<xref target="I-D.ietf-6tisch-terminology"/>, <xref target="RFC7252"/>,
<xref target="I-D.ietf-core-object-security"/>, and
<xref target="I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra"/>.  The following terms are
imported: drop ship, imprint, enrollment, pledge, join proxy, ownership
voucher, join registrar/coordinator.  The following terms are repeated here for readability,
but this document is not authoritative for their definition:</t>

<t><list style="hanging">
  <t hangText='pledge'>
  the prospective device, which has the identity provided to
at the factory.  Neither the device nor the network knows if the
device yet knows if this device belongs with this network.</t>
  <t hangText='Joined Node'>
  the prospective device, after having completing the join process, often just called a Node.</t>
  <t hangText='Join Proxy (JP):'>
  a stateless relay that provides connectivity between the pledge
and the join registrar/coordinator.</t>
  <t hangText='Join Registrar/Coordinator (JRC):'>
  central entity responsible for authentication and authorization of joining nodes.</t>
  <t hangText='Audit Token'>
  A signed token from the manufacturer authorized signing
authority indicating that the bootstrapping event has been
successfully logged.  This has been referred to as an
"authorization token" indicating that it authorizes bootstrapping
to proceed.</t>
  <t hangText='Ownership Voucher'>
  A signed voucher from the vendor vouching that a specific domain "owns"
the new entity as defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-anima-voucher"/>.</t>
  <t hangText='MIC'>
  manufacturer installed certificate. An <xref target="ieee802-1AR"/> identity. Not to be confused with a (cryptographic) "Message Integrity Check"</t>
</list></t>

</section>
<section anchor="scope-of-solution" title="Scope of solution">

<t>The solution described in this document is appropriate to enrolling between hundreds to hundreds of
thousands of diverse devices into a network without any prior contact with the devices.  The devices
could be shipped by the manufacturer directly to the customer site without ever being seen by the
operator of the network.  As described in BRSKI, in the audit-mode of operation the device will be claimed
by the first network that sees it. In the tracked owner mode of operation, sales channel integration
provides a strong connection that the operator of the network is the
legitimate owner of the device.</t>

<t>BRSKI describes a more general, more flexible approach for bootstrapping devices into an ISP or Enterprise
network.</t>

<t><xref target="I-D.ietf-6tisch-minimal-security"/> provides an extremely streamlined approach to enrolling from
hundreds to thousands of devices into a network, provided that a unique secret key can be installed
in each device.</t>

<section anchor="leveraging-the-new-key-infrastructure-next-steps" title="Leveraging the new key infrastructure / next steps">

<t>In constrained networks, it is unlikely that an ACP be formed.
This document does not preclude such a thing, but it is not mandated.</t>

<t>The resulting secure channel MAY be used just to distribute network-wide
keys using a protocol such as <xref target="I-D.ietf-6tisch-minimal-security"/>.
(XXX &#8211; do we need to signal this somehow?)</t>

<t>The resulting secure channel MAY be instead used to do an enrollment
of an LDevID as in BRSKI, but the resulting certificate is used to do
per-pair keying such as described by {{ieee802159}.</t>

<section anchor="key-distribution-process" title="Key Distribution Process">

<t>In addition to being used for the initial enrollment process, the secure
channel may be kept open (and reversed) to use for network rekeying.
Such a process is out of scope of this document, please see future work such
as <xref target="I-D.richardson-6tisch-minimal-rekey"/>.</t>

<section anchor="architectural-overview" title="Architectural Overview">

<t>Section 2 of BRSKI has a diagram with all of the components shown together.
There are no significant changes to the diagram.</t>

<t>The use of a circuit proxy is not mandated. Instead the IPIP mechanism
described in appendix C ("IPIP Join Proxy mechanism") SHOULD be be used
instead as it supports both DTLS, EDHOC and OSCOAP protocols.</t>

<t>The CoAP proxy mechanism MAY be implemented instead: the decision depends
upon the capabilities of the Registrar and the proxy.  A mechanism is included for the
Registrar to announce it's capabilities (XXX)</t>

<t>State descriptions for the pledge are as follows:</t>

<t><list style="numbers">
  <t>Discover a communication channel to a Registrar.   This is done by
listening for beacons as described by <xref target="I-D.richardson-anima-6join-discovery"/></t>
  <t>Identify itself.  This is done by presenting an X.509 IDevID credential
to the discovered Registrar (via the Proxy) in a DTLS or EDHOC handshake.
(The Registrar credentials are only provisionally accepted at this time).  <vspace blankLines='1'/>
The registrar identifies itself using a raw public key, while the the
pledge identifies itself to the registrar using an IDevID credential.</t>
  <t>Requests to Join the discovered Registrar.  A unique nonce can be
included ensuring that any responses can be associated with this
particular bootstrapping attempt.</t>
  <t>Imprint on the Registrar.  This requires verification of the
vendor service (MASA) provided voucher.  A voucher contains sufficient
information for the Pledge to complete authentication of a
Registrar.  The voucher is signed by the vendor (MASA) using a raw public
key, previously installed into the pledge at manufacturing time.</t>
  <t>Optionally Enroll.  By accepting the domain specific information from a
   Registrar, and by obtaining a domain certificate from a Registrar
   using a standard enrollment protocol, e.g.  Enrollment over
   Secure Transport (EST) <xref target="RFC7030"></xref>.</t>
  <t>The Pledge is now a member of, and can be managed by, the domain
   and will only repeat the discovery aspects of bootstrapping if it
   is returned to factory default settings.</t>
</list></t>

</section>
<section anchor="secure-imprinting-using-vouchers" title="Secure Imprinting using Vouchers">

<t>As in BRSKI, the format and cryptographic mechansim of vouchers is described in detail
in <xref target="I-D.ietf-anima-voucher"/>.  As described in section YYY, the physical format for vouchers
in this document differs from that of BRSKI, in that it uses <xref target="I-D.ietf-ace-cbor-web-token"/>
to encode the voucher and to sign it.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="initial-device-identifier" title="Initial Device Identifier">

<t>The essential component of the zero-touch operation is that the pledge is provisioned
with an 802.1AR (PKIX) certificate installed during the manufacturing process.</t>

<t>It is expected that constrained devices will use a signature algorithm corresponding to the
hardware acceleration that they have, if they have any.  The anticipated algorithms are
the ECDSA P-256 (secp256p1) as SHOULD-, while newer devices SHOLD+ begin to appear using
EdDSA curves using the 25519 curves. (EDNOTE details here)</t>

<t>There are a number of simplications detailed later on in this document
designed to eliminate the need for an ASN.1 parser in the pledge.</t>

<t>The pledge should consider it's 802.1AR certificate to be an opaque blob of
bytes, to be inserted into protocols at appropriate places.  The pledge
SHOULD have access to it's public and private keys in the most useable native
format for computation.</t>

<t>The pledge MUST have the public key of the MASA built in a manufacturer time.
This is a seemingly identical requirement as for BRSKI, but rather than being
an abstract trust anchor that can be augmented with a certificate chain, the
pledge MUST be provided with the Raw Public Key that the MASA will use to
sign vouchers for that pledge.</t>

<t>There are a number of security concerns with use of a single MASA signing
key, and section <xref target="masaprivatekey"/> addresses some of them with some
operational suggestions.</t>

<t>BRSKI places some clear requirements upon the contents of the IDevID, but
leaves the exact origin of the voucher serial-number open.  This document
restricts the process to being the hwSerialNum OCTET STRING.  As CWT can
handle binary formats, no base64 encoding is necessary.</t>

<t>The use of the MASA-URL extension is encouraged if the certificate is sent at all.</t>

<t>EDNOTE: here belongs text about sending only a reference to the IDevID rather
than the entire certificate</t>

<t>The Domain Registrar (having the formal name Join Registrar/

   any Pledge device expected on the network.  The Registrar
   communicates with the Vendor supplied MASA to establish ownership.</t>

<t>The JRC is typically located on the 6LBR/DODAG root, but it may be
   located elsewhere, provided IP level connectivity can be established.
   The 6LBR may also provide a proxy or relay function to connect to the
   actual registrar in addition to the IPIP proxy described above.

   "This module defines the format for a voucher, which is produced by
    a pledge's manufacturer or delegate (MASA) to securely assign one
    or more pledges to an 'owner', so that the pledges may establish a
    secure connection to the owner's network infrastructure.

    This version provides a very restricted subset appropriate
    for very constrained devices.
    In particular, it assumes that nonce-ful operation is
    always required, that expiration dates are rather weak, as no
    clocks can be assumed, and that the Registrar is identified
    by a pinned Raw Public Key.

    The key words 'MUST', 'MUST NOT', 'REQUIRED', 'SHALL', 'SHALL NOT',
    'SHOULD', 'SHOULD NOT', 'RECOMMENDED', 'MAY', and 'OPTIONAL' in
    the module text are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.";

of DTLS-providing the OSCOAP security, but such a specification does not yet exist.</t>

<t><xref target="I-D.vanderstok-ace-coap-est"/> specifies that CoAP specifies
the use of CoAP Block-Wise Transfer ("Block") <xref target="RFC7959"/> to fragment EST messages at the
application layer.</t>

<t>BRSKI introduces the concept of a provisional state for EST. The same situation
must also be added to DTLS: a situation where the connection is active but the identity of
the Registar has not yet been confirmed.  The DTLS MUST validate that the exchange has
been signed by the Raw Public Key that is presented by the Server, even though there is
as yet no trust in that key.  Such a key is often available through APIs that provide for
channel binding, such as described in <xref target="RFC5056"/>.</t>

<t>The voucher request and response as defined by BRSKI is modified slightly.</t>

<t>In order to simplify the pledge, the use of a certificate (and chain) for the
Registrar is not supported.  Instead the newly
defined pinned-domain-subject-public-key-info must contain the (raw) public key
info for the Registrar.  It MUST be byte for byte identical to that

<t><xref target="I-D.ietf-6lo-privacy-considerations"/> details a number of privacy
considerations important in Resource Constrained nodes.  There are two
networks and three sets of constrained nodes to consider. They are:
1. the production nodes on the production network.
2. the new pledges, which have yet to enroll, and which are on a join
network.
3. the production nodes which are also acting as proxy nodes.</t>

<section anchor="privacy-considerations-for-production-network" title="Privacy Considerations for Production network">

<t>The details of this are out of scope for this document.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="privacy-considerations-for-new-pledges" title="Privacy Considerations for New Pledges">

<t>New Pledges do not yet receive Router Advertisements with PIO options, and so
configure link-local addresses only based upon layer-2 addresses using the
normal SLAAC mechanisms described in <xref target="RFC4191"/>.</t>

<t>These link-local addresses are visible to any on-link eavesdropper (who is
synchronized to the same Join Assistant), so regardless of what is chosen
they can be seen.  This link-layer traffic is encapsulated by the Join
Proxy into IPIP packets and carried to the JRC.  The traffic SHOULD never
leave the operator's network, will be kept confidential by the layer-2 keys
inside the LLN.   As no outside traffic can enter the join network,
to do any ICMP scanning as described in <xref target="I-D.ietf-6lo-privacy-considerations"/>.</t>

<t>The join process described herein requires that some identifier meaningful to
the network operator be communicated to the JRC.  The join request with this
object occurs within a secured CoAP channel, although the link-local address configured
by the pledge will be visible in either the CoAP stateless proxy option
(section 5.1 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-6tisch-minimal-security"/>), or in the equivalent
DTLS stateless proxy option (reference TBD).</t>

<t>This need not be a manufacturer created EUI-64 as assigned by IEEE; it could be another
value with higher entropy and less interesting vendor/device information.
Regardless of what is chosen, it can be used to track where the device attaches.</t>

<t>For most constrained device, network attachment occurs very infrequently,
often only once in their lifetime, so tracking opportunities may be rare.
Once connected, the long 8-byte EUI64 layer-2 address is usually replaced with a short
JRC assigned 2-byte address.</t>

<t>Additionally, during the enrollment process, a DTLS connection or EDHOC
connection will be created.  TLS1.3 will keep contents of the certificates transmitted
private while TLS 1.2 will not.  If the client certificate can be observed,
then the device identity will be visible to passive observers in the 802.11AR IDevID
certificate that is sent.</t>

<t>Even when TLS 1.3 is used, an active attacker could collect the information by
creating a rogue proxy.</t>

<t>The use of a manufacturer assigned EUI64 (whether derived from IEEE assignment or
created through another process during manufacturing time) is encouraged.</t>

<section anchor="eui-64-derived-address-for-join-time-iid" title="EUI-64 derived address for join time IID">

<t>The IID used in the link-local address used during the join process be a
vendor assigned EUI-64.  After the join process has concluded, the device
SHOULD be assigned a unique randomly generated long address, and a
unique short address (not based upon the vendor EUI-64) for use at link-layer address.
At that point, all layer-3 content is encrypted by the layer-2 key.</t>

<t>The following text is from previous versions of this document.
The document has been re-organized to match the flow
of <xref target="I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra"/>.</t>

<section anchor="assumptions" title="Assumptions">

<section anchor="one-touch-assumptions" title="One-Touch Assumptions">

<t>This document interacts with the one-touch solution
described in <xref target="I-D.ietf-6tisch-minimal-security"/>.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="factory-provided-credentials-if-any" title="Factory provided credentials (if any)">

<t>When a manufacturer installed certificate is provided as the IDevID, it
SHOULD contain a number of fields.  <xref target="I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra"/>
provides a detailed set of requirements.</t>

<t>A manufacturer unique serial number MUST be provided in the serialNumber
SubjectAltName extension, and MAY be repeated in the Common Name. There are
no sequential or numeric requirements on the serialNumber, it may be any
unique value that the manufacturer wants to use.  The serialNumber SHOULD be
printed on the packaging and/or on the device in a discrete way so that failures
can be physically traced to the relevant device.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="credentials-to-be-introduced" title="Credentials to be introduced">

<t>The goal of the bootstrap process is to introduce one or more new locally
relevant credentials:</t>

<t><list style="numbers">
  <t>a certificate signed by a local certificate authority/registrar. This is
the LDevID of <xref target="ieee802-1AR"/>.</t>
  <t>alternatively, a network-wide key to be used to secure L2 traffic.</t>
  <t>alternatively, a network-wide key to be used to authenticate per-peer
keying of L2 traffic using a mechanism such as provided by <xref target="ieee802159"/>.</t>
</list></t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="network-assumptions" title="Network Assumptions">

<t>This document is about enrollment of constrained devices <xref target="RFC7228"/> to a
constrained network.  Constrained networks is such as <xref target="ieee802154"/>, and in
particular the time-slotted, channel hopping (tsch) mode, feature low
bandwidths, and limited opportunities to transmit.  A key feature of these
networks is that receivers are only listening at certain times.</t>

<section anchor="security-above-and-below-ip" title="Security above and below IP">

<t>802.15.4 networks have three kinds of layer-2 security:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>a network key that is shared with all nodes and is used for unicast and multicast.  The key may be used for privacy, and it may be used in some cases for authentication only (in the case of enhanced beacons).</t>
  <t>a series of network keys that are shared (agreed to) between pairs of nodes (the per-peer key)</t>
  <t>a network key that is shared with all nodes (through a group key management system), and is used for multicast traffic only, while a per-pair key is used for unicast traffic</t>
</list></t>

<t>Setting up the credentials to bootstrap one of these kinds of security,
(or directly configuring the key itself for the first case) is required.
This is the security below the IP layer.</t>

<t>Security is required above the IP layer: there are three aspects which the
credentials in the previous section are to be used.</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>to provide for secure connection with a Path Computation Element <xref target="RFC4655"/>, or other LLC (see ({RFC7554}} section 3).</t>
  <t>to initiate a connection between a Resource Server (RS) and an application layer Authorization Server (AS and CAS from <xref target="I-D.ietf-ace-actors"/>).</t>
</list></t>

<section anchor="perfect-forward-secrecy" title="Perfect Forward Secrecy">

<t>Perfert Forward Secrecy (PFS) is the property of a protocol such that complete
knowledge of the crypto state (for instance, via a memory dump) at
time X does not imply that data from a disjoint time Y can also be recovered.
(<xref target="PFS"/>).</t>

<t>PFS is important for two reasons: one is that it offers protection against
the compromise of a node.  It does this by changing the keys in a
non-deterministic way. This second property also makes it much easier to
remove a node from the network, as any node which has not participated in
the key changing process will find itself no longer connected.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="join-network-assumptions" title="Join network assumptions">

<t>The network which the new pledge will connect to will have to have the following properties:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>a known PANID.  The PANID 0xXXXX where XXXX is the assigned RFC# for this document is suggested.</t>
  <t>a minimal schedule with some Aloha time.  This is usually in the same slotframe as the Enhanced Beacon, but a pledge MUST listen for an unencrypted Enhanced Beacon to so that it can synchronize.</t>
</list></t>

<section anchor="target-end-state-for-join-process" title="Target end-state for join process">

<t>At the end of the zero-touch join process there will be a symmetric key protected channel
between the Join Registrar/Coordinator and the pledge, now known as a Joined Node.  This
channel may be rekeyed via new exchange of asymmetric exponents (ECDH for instance), authenticated
using the domain specific credentials created during the join process.</t>

<t>This channel is in the form of an OSCOAP protected connection with <xref target="I-D.ietf-core-comi"/> encoded objects.
This document includes definition of a <xref target="I-D.ietf-netconf-keystore"/> compatible objects for
encoding of the relevant <xref target="I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra"/> objects.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="join-protocol" title="Join Protocol">

<t>The pledge join protocol state machine is described in <xref target="I-D.ietf-6tisch-minimal-security"/>,
in section XYZ.  The pledge recognizes that it is in zero-touch configuration by the following
situation:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>no PSK has been configured for the network in which it has joined.</t>
  <t>the pledge has no locally defined certificate (no LDevID), only an IDevID.</t>
  <t>the network asserts an identity that the pledge does not recognize.</t>
</list></t>

<t>All of these conditions MUST be true.  If any of these are not true, then the pledge has either been
connected to the wrong network, or it has already been bootstrapped into a
different network, and it should wait until it finds that network.</t>

<t>The zero-touch process consists of three stages:</t>

<t><list style="numbers">
  <t>the key agreement process</t>
  <t>the provisional enrollment process</t>
  <t>the key distribution process</t>
</list></t>

<section anchor="key-agreement-process" title="Key Agreement process">

<t>The key agreement process is identical to <xref target="I-D.ietf-6tisch-minimal-security"/>.
The process uses EDHOC with certificates.</t>

<t>The pledge will have to trust the JRC provisionally, as described
in <xref target="I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra"/>, section 3.1.2, and
in section 4.1.1 of <xref target="RFC7030"/>.</t>

<t>The JRC will be able to validate the IDevID of the pledge using the
manufacturer's CA.</t>

<t>The pledge may not know if it is in a zero-touch or one-touch situation: the
pledge may be able to verify the JRC based upon trust anchors that were
installed at manufacturing time.  In that case, the pledge runs the
simplified one-touch process.</t>

<t>The pledge signals in the EDHOC message_2 if it has accepted the JRC
certificate.  The JRC will in general, not trust the pledge with the network
keys until it has provided the pledge with a voucher.  The pledge will notice
the absence of the provisioning keys.</t>

<t>XXX - there could be some disconnect here.  May need additional signals here.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="provisional-enrollment-process" title="Provisional Enrollment process">

<t>When the pledge determines that it can not verify the certificate of the JRC
using built-in trust anchors, then it enters a provisional state.  In this
state, it keeps the channel created by EDHOC open.</t>

<t>A new EDHOC key derivation is done by the JRC and pledge using a new label,
"6tisch-provisional".</t>

<t>The pledge runs as a passive CoMI server, leaving the JRC to drive the
enrollment process.   The JRC can interrogate the pledge in a variety of
fashions as shown below: the process terminates when the JRC provides
the pledge with an ownership voucher and the pledge leaves the provisional
state.</t>

<t>A typical interaction involves the following requests:</t>
