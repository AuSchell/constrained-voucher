Abstract

   This document describes a zero-touch mechanism to enroll a new device
   (the "pledge") into a IEEE802.15.4 TSCH network using the 6tisch
   signaling mechanisms.  The resulting device will obtain a domain
   specific credential that can be used with either 802.15.9 per-host
   pair keying protocols, or to obtain the network-wide key from a
   coordinator.  The mechanism describe her is an augmentation to the
   one-touch mechanism described in [I-D.ietf-6tisch-minimal-security].

1.  Introduction

   Enrollment of new nodes into LLNs present unique challenges.  The
   constrained nodes has no user interfaces, and even if they did,
   configuring thousands of such nodes manually is undesireable from a
   human resources issue, as well as the difficulty in getting
   consistent results.

   This document is about a standard way to introduce new nodes into a
   6tisch network that does not involve any direct manipulation of the



Richardson               Expires August 15, 2017                [Page 2]

Internet-Draft         6tisch Secure Join protocol         February 2017


   nodes themselves.  This act has been called "zero-touch"
   provisioning, and it does not occur by chance, but requires
   coordination between the manufacturer of the node, the service
   operator running the LLN, and the installers actually taking the
   devices out of the shipping boxes.

   The act of doing "one-touch" provisioning, where a node undergoes a
   site-specific indoctrination process is described in
   [I-D.ietf-6tisch-minimal-security].

   The mechanism described here and in
   [I-D.ietf-6tisch-minimal-security] can be discovered by a new node in
   a running network, so a device which has received a network-specific
   "one-touch" setup, but which is located in another network, and is
   capable of "zero-touch" operation could discovery this fact and
   operate in other mode.

   Many of the zero-touch mechanisms described here are in common with
   [I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra] and
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-zerotouch].  The on-the-wire pledge to join
   registrar protocols are different in this protocol from those
   described in ANIMA, but conceptually operate identically.  It is
   expected that the back-end network operator infrastructure would be
   able to bootstrap ANIMA-type devices over ethernet, while also being
   able bootstrap 6tisch devices over 802.15.4 with few changes.

1.1.  Terminology

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119] and indicate requirement levels for compliant STuPiD
   implementations.

   The reader is expected to be familiar with the terms and concepts
   defined in [I-D.ietf-6tisch-terminology], [RFC7252],
   [I-D.ietf-core-object-security], and
   [I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra].  The following terms are
   imported: drop ship, imprint, enrollment, pledge, join proxy,
   ownership voucher, join registrar/coordinator.  The following terms
   are repeated here for readability, but this document is not
   authoritative for their definition:

   pledge  the prospective device, which has the identity provided to at
      the factory.  Neither the device nor the network knows if the
      device yet knows if this device belongs with this network.





Richardson               Expires August 15, 2017                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft         6tisch Secure Join protocol         February 2017


   Joined Node  the prospective device, after having completing the join
      process, often just called a Node.

   Join Proxy (JP):  a stateless relay that provides connectivity
      between the pledge and the join registrar/coordinator.

   Join Registrar/Coordinator (JRC):  central entity responsible for
      authentication and authorization of joining nodes.

   Audit Token  A signed token from the manufacturer authorized signing
      authority indicating that the bootstrapping event has been
      successfully logged.  This has been referred to as an
      "authorization token" indicating that it authorizes bootstrapping
      to proceed.

   Ownership Voucher  A signed voucher from the vendor vouching that a
      specific domain "owns" the new entity as defined in
      [I-D.ietf-netconf-zerotouch].

   MIC  manufacturer installed certificate.  An [ieee802-1AR] identity.

1.2.  Credentials

   In the zero-touch scenario, every device expected to be drop shipped
   would have an [ieee802-1AR] manufacturer installed certificate (MIC).
   The private key part of the certificate would either be generated in
   the device, or installed securely (and privately) as part of the
   manufacturing process.  [cullenCiscoPhoneDeploy] provides an example
   of process which has been active for a good part of a decade.

   The MIC would be signed by the manufacturer's CA, the public key
   component of that would be included in the firmware.

1.2.1.  One-Touch Assumptions

   This document interacts with the one-touch solution described in
   [I-D.ietf-6tisch-minimal-security].

1.2.2.  Factory provided credentials (if any)

   When a manufacturer installed certificate is provided as the IDevID,
   it SHOULD contain a number of fields.
   [I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra] provides a detailed set of
   requirements.

   A manufacturer unique serial number MUST be provided in the
   serialNumber SubjectAltName extension, and MAY be repeated in the
   Common Name.  There are no sequential or numeric requirements on the



Richardson               Expires August 15, 2017                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft         6tisch Secure Join protocol         February 2017


   serialNumber, it may be any unique value that the manufacturer wants
   to use.  The serialNumber SHOULD be printed on the packaging and/or
   on the device in a discrete way so that failures can be physically
   traced to the relevant device.

1.2.3.  Credentials to be introduced

   The goal of the bootstrap process is to introduce one or more new
   locally relevant credentials:

   1.  a certificate signed by a local certificate authority/registrar.
       This is the LDevID of [ieee802-1AR].

   2.  alternatively, a network-wide key to be used to secure L2
       traffic.

   3.  alternatively, a network-wide key to be used to authenticate per-
       peer keying of L2 traffic using a mechanism such as provided by
       [ieee802159].

1.3.  Network Assumptions

   This document is about enrollment of constrained devices [RFC7228] to
   a constrained network.  Constrained networks is such as [ieee802154],
   and in particular the time-slotted, channel hopping (tsch) mode,
   feature low bandwidths, and limited opportunities to transmit.  A key
   feature of these networks is that receivers are only listening at
   certain times.

1.3.1.  Security above and below IP

   802.15.4 networks have three kinds of layer-2 security:

   o  a network key that is shared with all nodes and is used for
      unicast and multicast.  The key may be used for privacy, and it
      may be used in some cases for authentication only (in the case of
      enhanced beacons).

   o  a series of network keys that are shared (agreed to) between pairs
      of nodes (the per-peer key)

   o  a network key that is shared with all nodes (through a group key
      management system), and is used for multicast traffic only, while
      a per-pair key is used for unicast traffic

   Setting up the credentials to bootstrap one of these kinds of
   security, (or directly configuring the key itself for the first case)
   is required.  This is the security below the IP layer.



Richardson               Expires August 15, 2017                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft         6tisch Secure Join protocol         February 2017


   Security is required above the IP layer: there are three aspects
   which the credentials in the previous section are to be used.

   o  to provide for secure connection with a Path Computation Element
      [RFC4655], or other LLC (see ({RFC7554}} section 3).

   o  to initiate a connection between a Resource Server (RS) and an
      application layer Authorization Server (AS and CAS from
      [I-D.ietf-ace-actors]).

1.3.1.1.  Perfect Forward Secrecy

   Perfert Forward Secrecy (PFS) is the property of a protocol such that
   complete knowledge of the crypto state (for instance, via a memory
   dump) at time X does not imply that data from a disjoint time Y can
   also be recovered.  ([PFS]).

   PFS is important for two reasons: one is that it offers protection
   against the compromise of a node.  It does this by changing the keys
   in a non-deterministic way.  This second property also makes it much
   easier to remove a node from the network, as any node which has not
   participated in the key changing process will find itself no longer
   connected.

1.3.2.  Join network assumptions

   The network which the new pledge will connect to will have to have
   the following properties:

   o  a known PANID.  The PANID 0xXXXX where XXXX is the assigned RFC#
      for this document is suggested.

   o  a minimal schedule with some Aloha time.  This is usually in the
      same slotframe as the Enhanced Beacon, but a pledge MUST listen
      for an unencrypted Enhanced Beacon to so that it can synchronize.

1.3.3.  Number and cost of round trips

   TBD.

1.3.4.  Size of packets, number of fragments

1.4.  Target end-state for join process

   At the end of the zero-touch join process there will be a symmetric
   key protected channel between the Join Registrar/Coordinator and the
   pledge, now known as a Joined Node.  This channel may be rekeyed via
   new exchange of asymmetric exponents (ECDH for instance),



Richardson               Expires August 15, 2017                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft         6tisch Secure Join protocol         February 2017


   authenticated using the domain specific credentials created during
   the join process.

   This channel is in the form of an OSCOAP protected connection with
   [I-D.ietf-core-comi] encoded objects.  This document includes
   definition of a [I-D.ietf-netconf-keystore] compatible objects for
   encoding of the relevant [I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra]
   objects.

2.  Join Protocol

   The pledge join protocol state machine is described in
   [I-D.ietf-6tisch-minimal-security], in section XYZ.  The pledge
   recognizes that it is in zero-touch configuration by the following
   situation:

   o  no PSK has been configured for the network in which it has joined.

   o  the pledge has no locally defined certificate (no LDevID), only an
      IDevID.

   o  the network asserts an identity that the pledge does not
      recognize.

   All of these conditions MUST be true.  If any of these are not true,
   then the pledge has either been connected to the wrong network, or it
   has already been bootstrapped into a different network.

2.1.  Description of Pledge States in Join Process

3.  Join Assistant to Registrar protocol

   In smaller one-touch scenarios the pledge may know quickly if it has
   found the right network to join as it can be configured with the
   network-ID (see [I-D.richardson-6tisch-join-enhanced-beacon]) along
   with the key.

   In zero-touch scenarios, there may be a myrid of possible networks to
   join, and the pledge may know which network it should join, and for
   how long it should wait.
   [I-D.richardson-6tisch-join-enhanced-beacon] provides for a mechanism
   where the Join Assistant may indicate to the pledge that it should
   remain silence, and wait to be contacted.  ("Don't call us, we'll
   call you")

   As part of the waiting protocol described in
   [I-D.ietf-6tisch-minimal-security] section WAITING, the pledge will
   do a Duplicate Address Detection as described in [RFC6775].  The

Internet-Draft         6tisch Secure Join protocol         February 2017


   pledge should include an ARO with it's EUI-64.  The status field of
   the ARO is extended (see (#ianaconsiderations)) to include an
   additional status value ND_NS_JOIN_DECLINED.  This provides for a way
   for a non-malicious to either accept or deny a new pledge.  This
   mechanism is not secure, and the pledge SHOULD be suspicious about
   such declarations.

   The pledge however, needs to refresh it's address with the Join
   Proxy, keeping the Neighbor Cache on the Join Proxy current.

   This section describes an optional protocol that the Join Proxy can
   use to make a determination with the JRC as to eligibility of the new
   pledge.

   XXXX

   There are three aspects to the protocols that the Join Proxy uses to
   communicate about its needs.  They are:

   1.  Discovery of Registrar

   2.  Notification of new pledge to Registrar

   3.  Passing of traffic from Pledge to Registar

3.1.  Discovery of Registrar

   The address of the registrar MAY be determined by other protocols,
   such as DHCP, RA or RPL extensions, or provisioned into the Join
   Assistant via other configuration protocol such as 6p.

   In order to support fully autonomic operations, the Join Assistant
   MAY use a GRASP discovery ([I-D.ietf-anima-grasp]) to find the
   address of the Registrar.  [I-D.richardson-anima-6join-discovery]
   describes the details of the process.

   In 6tisch networks multicast is not always available, requiring
   additional protocol [RFC7731] effort.  Instead of doing a multicast
   GRASP discovery, the Join Assistant SHOULD instead to a TCP connect
   to the GRASP_LISTEN_PORT on the IP address of the DODAG root (when
   RPL is used as the routing protocol for 6tisch), or the ABRO address
   when another protocol is used.  The Join Assistant should then issue
   the appropriate M_DISCOVERY method using the 6JOIN objective.  The
   GRASP discovery will then reply using the same TCP connection as per
   Unicast Discovery in [I-D.ietf-anima-grasp] section TBD.

Internet-Draft         6tisch Secure Join protocol         February 2017


3.2.  Notification of a new pledge to Registar

   As illustrated in (#joindiagram), when the Join Assistant receives a
   Neighbor Solication from a pledge, it must notify the Registar of the
   pledge, indicating to it how to reach the new pledge.  The Registrar
   will respond with a positive acknowledgement if the Registrar is
   willing/able to accept the pledge.  The Registrar will respond with a
   negative acknowledgement if the provided pledge identity (the IID in
   the ARO) is not one that the Registrar recognizes as belonging to
   this network.

   The Registrar runs an ASA which is called the 6JOIN ASA (which can be
   discovered above).  This query/response is done using GRASP with the
   discovered ASA process.

   The query process is described in CDDL as:

request-6join-query = [M_REQ_NEG, session-id, "6JOIN", [IID, "6p-ipip"]]
IID = bytes .size 8

   The response from the Registrar is describe as:

   response-6join-query = [M_END, session-id, [O_ACCEPT]]

   or for a negative response:

   response-6join-query = [M_END, session-id, [O_DECLINE]]

   for the 6p-ipip, the Registrar will need to know where to send the
   IPIP packets to.  The Join Assistant will initiate the TCP connection
   to the Registrar's ASA using the IPv6 address associated with the
   insecure interface on which the pledge is located, i.e. using the
   PTEPA.

3.3.  Passing of traffic from Pledge to Registar

   When the Registrar is ready to initiate the pledge into the domain,
   the Registrar will reach out to the pledge using a secure CoAP
   protocol (6p).  The security is provided using DTLS or EDHOC.  As the
   pledge has only a link-local address, and the Registrar is not co-
   located on the same layer-2 as the pledge, the traffic must be
   relayed through the Join Assistant.

   To do this the Registrar needs to configure a Link Local address on a
   virtual inteface which is the same as the PTEPA derived address.

   The Registrar then sends it's traffic (UDP packets with CoAPS
   inside), inside of an IPIP header to the Join Assistant.  The outer



Richardson               Expires August 15, 2017                [Page 9]

Internet-Draft         6tisch Secure Join protocol         February 2017


   IP header is from the Registrar to the PTEPA.  The inner IP is from
   the link local address configured above, and the destination is the
   Link Local address of the pledge.

   The Registrar knows the IJALL by taking the IID from the connection
   address above, and knows the Link Local of the pledge from the IID in
   the objective message.

   The Join Assistant, upon receipt of the IPIP traffic from the
   Registar on it's PTEPA, then decapsulates it and forwards it on the
   appropriate.  (This is identical code to decapsulation of IPIP
   headers as specified in [I-D.ietf-roll-useofrplinfo].

   The Join Assistant, upon receiving traffic from the pledge to the
   IJALL, it encapsulates it into an IPIP header, setting the source of
   this outer header to the PTEPA, and the destination being the
   Registrar.

   The Join Assistant can do this for as many pledges as the Registrar
   decides to communicate with, without using any additional per-pledge
   state other than the obligatory Neighbor Cache Entries needed to
   translate L3 addresses to L2 addresses.

4.  Privacy Considerations

   [I-D.ietf-6lo-privacy-considerations] details a number of privacy
   considerations important in Resource Constrained nodes.  There are
   two networks and three sets of constrained nodes to consider.  They
   are: 1. the production nodes on the production network.  2. the new
   pledges, which have yet to enroll, and which are on a join network.
   3. the production nodes which are also acting as proxy nodes.

4.1.  Privacy Considerations for Production network

   The details of this are out of scope for this document.

4.2.  Privacy Considerations for New Pledges

   New Pledges do not yet receive Router Advertisements with PIO
   options, and so configure link-local addresses only based upon
   layer-2 addresses using the normal SLAAC mechanisms described in
   [RFC4191].

   These link-local addresses are visible to any on-link eavesdropper
   (who is synchronized to the same Join Assistant), so regardless of
   what is chosen they can be seen.  This link-layer traffic is
   encapsulated by the Join Assistant into IPIP packets and carried to
   the JCE.  The traffic SHOULD never leave the operator's network, and



Richardson               Expires August 15, 2017               [Page 10]

Internet-Draft         6tisch Secure Join protocol         February 2017


   no outside traffic should enter, so it should not be possible to do
   any ICMP scanning as described in
   [I-D.ietf-6lo-privacy-considerations].

   The join process described herein requires that some identifier
   meaningful to the network operator be communicated to the JCE via the
   Neighbor Advertisement's ARO option.  This need not be a manufacturer
   created EUI-64 as assigned by IEEE; it could be another value with
   higher entropy and less interesting vendor/device information.
   Regardless of what is chosen, it can be used to track where the
   device attaches.

   For most constrained device, network attachment occurs very
   infrequently, often only once in their lifetime, so tracking
   opportunities may be rare.

   Further, during the enrollment process, a DTLS connection connection
   will be created.  Unless TLS1.3 is used, the device identity will be
   visible to passive observers in the 802.11AR IDevID certificate that
   is sent.  Even when TLS1.3 is used, an active attacker could collect
   the information by simply connecting to the device; it would not have
   to successful complete the negotiation either, or even attempt to
   Man-In-The-Middle the device.

   There is, at the same time, significant value in avoiding a link-
   local DAD process by using an IEEE assigned EUI-64, and there is also
   significant advantage to the operator being able to see what the
   vendor of the new device is.

4.2.1.  EUI-64 derived address for join time IID

   It is therefore suggested that the IID used in the link-local address
   used during the join process be a vendor assigned EUI-64.  After the
   join process has concluded, the device SHOULD be assigned a unique
   randomly generated long address, and a unique short address (not
