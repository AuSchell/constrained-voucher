1.  Introduction

   Enrollment of new nodes into LLNs present unique challenges.  The
   constrained nodes has no user interfaces, and even if they did,
   configuring thousands of such nodes manually is undesireable from a
   human resources issue, as well as the difficulty in getting
   consistent results.

Internet-Draft         6tisch Secure Join protocol          October 2016


   This document is about a standard way to introduce new nodes into a
   6tisch network that does not involve any direct manipulation of the
   nodes themselves.  This act has been called "zero-touch"
   provisioning, and it does not occur by chance, but requires
   coordination between the manufacturer of the node, the service
   operator running the LLN, and the installers actually taking the
   devices out of the shipping boxes.

   In other installations (such as some factory/industrial settings, and
   for some utilities), it is possible to pass devices through a
   "provisioning" room of some kind where the device in factory default
   state may be touched once (via a cable, or a push button, or by being
   placed in a faraday cage, etc.) such that the devices can be
   initialized in a way specific to that installation.  The devices are
   then returned to inventory, and may be deployed at some future time.
   The node is not provisioned with the current keying material, as the
   network will need to be regularly rekeyed (even the algorithms may
   change!), so in the one-touch provisioning case, the goal is simply
   to introduce some elements into the new node (the "pledge") such that
   the enrollment process will take less energy and fewer network
   resources.

1.1.  Terminology

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119] and indicate requirement levels for compliant STuPiD
   implementations.

   The following terminology is repeated from
   [I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra] so as to have a common way to
   speak:

   drop ship  The physical distribution of equipment containing the
      "factory default" configuration to a final destination.  In zero-
      touch scenarios there is no staging or pre-configuration during
      drop-ship.

   imprint  the process where a device obtains the cryptographic key
      material to identity and trust future interactions with a network.
      This term is taken from Konrad Lorenz's work in biology with new
      ducklings: during a critical period, the duckling would assume
      that anything that looks like a mother duck is in fact their
      mother.  An equivalent for a device is to obtain the fingerprint
      of the network's root certification authority certificate.  A
      device that imprints on an attacker suffers a similar fate to a

      duckling that imprints on a hungry wolf.  Securely imprinting is a
      primary focus of this document. [duckling] anticipates this use.

   enrollment  the process where a device presents key material to a
      network and acquires a network specific identity.  For example
      when a certificate signing request is presented to a certification
      authority and a certificate is obtained in response.

   pledge  the prospective device, which has the identity provided to at
      the factory.  Neither the device nor the network knows if the
      device yet knows if this device belongs with this network.  This
      is definition 6, according to [pledge].

   Audit Token  A signed token from the manufacturer authorized signing
      authority indicating that the bootstrapping event has been
      successfully logged.  This has been referred to as an
      "authorization token" indicating that it authorizes bootstrapping
      to proceed.

   Ownership Voucher  A signed voucher from the vendor vouching that a
      specific domain "owns" the new entity as defined in
      [I-D.ietf-netconf-zerotouch].

1.2.  Credentials

   In the zero-touch scenario, every device expected to be drop shipped
   would have an [ieee802-1AR] manufacturer installed certificate (MIC).
   The private key part of the certificate would either be generated in
   the device, or installed securely (and privately) as part of the
   manufacturer process.  [cullenCiscoPhoneDeploy] provides an example
   of process which has been active for a good part of a decade.

   The MIC would be signed by the manufacturer's CA, the public key
   component of that would be included in the firmware.

1.2.1.  One-Touch Assumptions

   In a one-touch scenario, devices would be provided with some
   mechanism by which a secure association may be made in a controlled
   environment.  There are many ways in which this might be done, and
   detailing any of them is out of scope for this document.  But, some
   notion of how this might be done is important so that the underlying
   assumptions can be reasoned about.

   Some examples of how to do this could include: * JTAG interface *
   serial (craft) console interface * pushes of physical buttons
   simulatenous to network attachment * insecured devices operated in a
   Faraday cage



Richardson               Expires April 22, 2017                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft         6tisch Secure Join protocol          October 2016


   There are likely many other ways as well.  What is assumed is that
   there can be a secure, private conversation between the Join
   Coordination Entity, and the Pledge, and that the two devices can
   exchange some trusted bytes of information.

1.2.2.  Factory provided credentials (if any)

   When a manufacturer installed certificate is provided as the IDevID,
   it SHOULD contain a number of fields.
   [I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra] provides a detailed set of
   requirements.

   A manufacturer unique serial number MUST be provided in the
   serialNumber SubjectAltName extension, and MAY be repeated in the
   Common Name.  There are no sequential or numeric requirements on the
   serialNumber, it may be any unique value that the manufacturer wants
   to use.  The serialNumber SHOULD be printed on the packaging and/or
   on the device in a discrete way.

1.2.3.  Credentials to be introduced

   The goal of the bootstrap process is to introduce one or more new
   locally relevant credentials:

   1.  a certificate signed by a local certificate authority/registrar.
       This is the LDevID of [ieee802-1AR].

   2.  alternatively, a network-wide key to be used to secure L2
       traffic.

   3.  alternatively, a network-wide key to be used to authenticate per-
       peer keying of L2 traffic using a mechanism such as provided by
       [ieee802159].

1.3.  Network Assumptions

   This document is about enrollment of constrained devices [RFC7228] to
   a constrained network.  Constrained networks is such as [ieee802154],
   and in particular the time-slotted, channel hopping (tsch) mode,
   feature low bandwidths, and limited opportunities to transmit.  A key
   feature of these networks is that receivers are only listening at
   certain times.

1.3.1.  Security above and below IP

   802.15.4 networks have three kinds of layer-2 security:





Richardson               Expires April 22, 2017                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft         6tisch Secure Join protocol          October 2016


   o  a network key that is shared with all nodes and is used for
      unicast and multicast.

   o  a series of network keys that are shared (agreed to) between pairs
      of nodes (the per-peer key)

   o  a network key that is shared with all nodes (through a group key
      management system), and is used for multicast traffic only

   Setting up the credentials to bootstrap one of these kinds of
   security, (or directly configuring the key itself for the first case)
   is required.  This is the security below the IP layer.

   Security is required above the IP layer: there are three aspects
   which the credentials in the previous section are to be used.

   o  to provide for secure connection with a Path Computation Element
      [RFC4655], or other LLC (see ({RFC7554}} section 3).

   o  to initiate a connection between a Resource Server (RS) and an
      application layer Authorization Server (AS and CAS from
      [I-D.ietf-ace-actors]).

1.3.1.1.  Perfect Forward Secrecy

   Perfert Forward Secrecy (PFS) is the property of a protocol such that
   complete knowledge of the crypto state (for instance, via a memory
   dump) at time X does not imply that data from a disjoint time Y can
   also be recovered.  ([PFS]).

   PFS is important for two reasons: one is that it offers protection
   against the compromise of a node.  It does this by changing the keys
   in a non-deterministic way.  This second property also makes it much
   easier to remove a node from the network, as any node which has not
   participated in the key changing process will find itself no longer
   connected.

1.3.2.  Join network assumptions

   The network which the new pledge will connect to will have to have
   the following properties:

   o  a known PANID.  The PANID 0xXXXX where XXXX is the assigned RFC#
      for this document is suggested.

   o  a minimal schedule with some Aloha time.  This is usually in the
      same slotframe as the Extended Beacon, but a pledge MUST listen
      for an unencrypted Extended Beacon to so that it can synchronize.

Internet-Draft         6tisch Secure Join protocol          October 2016


   o  a known K1 key, as described in [I-D.ietf-6tisch-minimal] section
      10, and used for reasons similar to [iec62591].

1.6.  Description of Pledge States in Join Process

1.6.1.  (1) Layer-2 Enhanced Beacon

   A new pledge must listen for a beacon for a period of at least 2s on
   each of the 16 possible channels.  The pledge SHOULD collect all
   beacons from heard on all channels before selecting a beacon to start
   with.  If the pledge is unable to record all of the beacons that it
   hears due to limitations on volatile storage, then it should at least
   attempt to record the detail as to how to find that beacon again
   (channel, time sequence).

   This search process entails having the pledge keep the receiver
   portion of it's radio active for the entire period of time.

   The selection of which beacon to start with is outside the scope of
   this document.  Implementers SHOULD make use of information such as:
   whether the L2 address of the Beacon has been tried before, whether a
   Router Advertisement IE is present, any Network Identifier
   [I-D.richardson-6lo-ra-in-ie] seen, and the strength of the signal.

Internet-Draft         6tisch Secure Join protocol          October 2016


   Once a candidate network has been selected, the pledge can transition
   into a low-power duty cycle, waking only when the provided schedule
   indicates ALOHA slots which the pledge may use for the join process.

1.6.2.  (1B) Layer-3 Router Advertisement

   If [I-D.richardson-6lo-ra-in-ie] has not been used to embed a router
   advertisement in the Enhanced Beacon, then the pledge MUST wait to
   hear a Router Advertisement to know the layer-3 address of the
   adjacent router.  These will be broadcast periodically during the
   ALOHA slot.

   A pledge MAY timeout and send a layer-2 unicast Router Solicitation
   (to the layer-2 of the Enhanced Beacon) to the layer-3 all-routers
   address.  A pledge MAY also take this timeout to mean that this
   router is unwilling to perform Join Assistant activities and the
   pledge should move on to another Enhanced Beacon.

1.6.3.  (2) Pledge sends (unicast) Neighbor Solicitation to Join
        Assistant

   This NS message is formed much like a Duplicate Address Detection
   (DAD) message described in [RFC6775] section-4.3: it is a
   solicitation by the pledge for it's own address.  [RFC6775] does not
   describe doing DAD for link-local address however, so this aspect is
   new.

   The Join Assistant will not validate the uniqueness using the DAR/DAC
   mechanism, but will otherwise process the NS as per normal:
   populating neighbor cache entries.  The Join Assistant will take
   extra care with expiring neighbor cache entries: unsecured NS should
   never push secured NCE entries out of the cache or overwrite them.
   There are two equivalent ways to do this:

   1.  marking the origin of the NCE and limiting unsecured ones to some
       portion of the entries;

   2.  by considering unsecured NS to be arriving from a different
       virtual interface (different if_index) than secured ones.  NCEs
       from different interfaces SHOULD already not be mixed.

   The pledge SHOULD NOT have configured a short Layer-2 address as it
   has no way to allocate a non-duplicate short address.  It SHOULD have
   formed a standard 64-bit layer-3 link-local address using a built-in
   IID.  This IID MUST be placed into the Address Resolution option
   (ARO) option in the Neighbor Soliciation, as it serves as the index
   by which the domain registrar will use to identify the device.

Internet-Draft         6tisch Secure Join protocol          October 2016


   The IID MAY be related to the layer-2 address, but privacy
   considerations recommend that the IID SHOULD instead be a form a
   stable privacy address [RFC7217].  Whichever method is used MUST be
   decided at manufacturing time, as the IID is also repeated as the
   SerialNumber in the Manufacturer Installed Certificate (MIC), also
   referred to as the 802.1AR IDevID.

1.6.4.  (3) Join Assistant sends Query to Registar

   This step does not involve the pledge, and it is described in section
   (#jastates).

1.6.5.  (4) Join Assistant receives Acceptance response from Registrar

   This step does not involve the pledge, and it is described in section
   (#jastates).

1.6.6.  (5) Pledge receives (unicast) Neighbor Advertisement from join
        assistant

   This NA message is again identical to the Duplicate Address Detection
   mechanism described in [RFC6775].  The status field of the ARO is
   extended (see (#ianaconsiderations)) to include an additional status
   value ND_NS_JOIN_DECLINED.

   The pledge, upon receipt of ND_NS_JOIN_DECLINED considers that this
   network is not an appropriate network to join, and SHOULD move on to
   attempt other networks.  The pledge MUST also realize that this NA
   message MAY have been forced, and it SHOULD attempt joining this
   network again at a future time, but MUST NOT repeatedly attempt to
   join the same network.

   The pledge, upon receipt of a Neighbor Cache Full response SHOULD
   attempt to join using a different join assistant on the same network.

   The pledge, upon receipt of a Duplicate Address response SHOULD
   attempt to join using a different join assistant on a different
   network, if it has such offers.  If it has no such offers, it should
   wait at least NEIGHBOR-CACHE TIMEOUT, and then retry.  This may be a
   sign of a Denial of Service attack, or it may be a non-malicious mis-
   configuration.

   Upon receive of a successful NA, the pledge SHOULD consider that it
   is now in enrolled in a join queue.  The pledge SHOULD resend
   Neighbor Soliciation (NUD) messages periodically as described in
   [RFC6775] to maintain the neighbor cache entry.

   A pledge with other Join Assistant offers MAY abandon this Join
   Assistant after a period of XXX minutes and attempt to join using a
   different Join Assistant.

2.  Privacy Considerations

   [I-D.ietf-6lo-privacy-considerations] details a number of privacy
   considerations important in Resource Constrained nodes.  There are
   two networks and three sets of constrained nodes to consider.  They
   are: 1. the production nodes on the production network.  2. the new
   pledges, which have yet to enroll, and which are on a join network.
   3. the production nodes which are also acting as proxy nodes.

2.1.  Privacy Considerations for Production network

   The details of this are out of scope for this document.

2.2.  Privacy Considerations for New Pledges

   New Pledges do not yet receive Router Advertisements with PIO
   options, and so configure link-local addresses only based upon
   layer-2 addresses using the normal SLAAC mechanisms described in
   [RFC4191].

   These link-local addresses are visible to any on-link eavesdropper
   (who is synchronized to the same Join Assistant), so regardless of
   what is chosen they can be seen.  This link-layer traffic is
   encapsulated by the Join Assistant into IPIP packets and carried to
   the JCE.  The traffic SHOULD never leave the operator's network, and
   no outside traffic should enter, so it should not be possible to do
   any ICMP scanning as described in
   [I-D.ietf-6lo-privacy-considerations].

   The join process described herein requires that some identifier
   meaningful to the network operator be communicated to the JCE via the
   Neighbor Advertisement's ARO option.  This need not be a manufacturer
   created EUI-64 as assigned by IEEE; it could be another value with
   higher entropy and less interesting vendor/device information.
   Regardless of what is chosen, it can be used to track where the
   device attaches.

   For most constrained device, network attachment occurs very
   infrequently, often only once in their lifetime, so tracking
   opportunities may be rare.

   Further, during the enrollment process, a DTLS connection connection
   will be created.  Unless TLS1.3 is used, the device identity will be
   visible to passive observers in the 802.11AR IDevID certificate that
   is sent.  Even when TLS1.3 is used, an active attacker could collect
   the information by simply connecting to the device; it would not have
   to successful complete the negotiation either, or even attempt to
   Man-In-The-Middle the device.

   There is, at the same time, significant value in avoiding a link-
   local DAD process by using an IEEE assigned EUI-64, and there is also
   significant advantage to the operator being able to see what the
   vendor of the new device is.

2.2.1.  EUI-64 derived address for join time IID

   It is therefore suggested that the IID used in the link-local address
   used during the join process be a vendor assigned EUI-64.  After the
   join process has concluded, the device SHOULD be assigned a unique
   randomly generated long address, and a unique short address (not
   based upon the vendor EUI-64) for use at link-layer.  At that point,
   all layer-3 content is encrypted by the layer-2 key.
